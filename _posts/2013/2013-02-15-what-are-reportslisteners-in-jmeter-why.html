<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div style="text-align: left;">In this article we are going to see what are the reports (Listeners) in JMeter and why we use that. Please see my previous posts for primary idea about jmeter.</div><div style="text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;">Jmeter Listener used to listen and process for suitable views/reports. That needed more memory and processor. Different listener of jmeter performs different purposes.<br />-Listeners are used to view/save/read from running/saved test results.<br />-Listeners are processed at the end of the scope in which they are found.<br />-The results are stored as XML files(".jtl" ext). But storing as CSV is the most efficient option[it is less detailed than XML]<br />-Listeners do not process sample data in non-GUI mode, but the raw result data will be saved if an output file(configured). We can load that data with any suitable Listener.(From File menu)<br /><br /><b>Using Tips :</b><br />-Clear (Ctrl+Shift+E)/Clear All (Ctrl+E) before loading any result file.<br />-Configure CSV format before string results from jmeter.properties.<br />-Use function name inside CSV not variable name for remote running(in client server more, variable does not saved) .<br />-Use Simple Data Writer, and use the CSV format. <br />[Note :<br />Most of the listeners currently keep a copy of every sample in their scope, so they are resource hungry.. These don't need to current data for processing separately, so they don't copy.<br />-Simple Data Writer<br />-BeanShell/BSF Listener<br />-Mailer Visualizer<br />-Monitor Results<br />-Summary Report<br /><br />And these Listeners don't keep copies of every single sample, so less memory needed.<br />You can see my configuring jmeter <a href="http://shantonusarker.blogspot.com/p/jmeter.html" target="_blank">posts</a> for having more idea on how to configure jmeter, listeners and all reports.<br /><br />In the following section, we will discuses more about why we use the particular listener, not about what is that because Jmeter <a href="http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#listeners" target="_blank">doc</a> provides vast information about that.<br /><br /><b>Aggregate Graph:</b><br />-The aggregate graph is similar to the aggregate report except showing results by bar graphs and save the graph as a PNG file.<br />-It is better to define the graph settings(spatially following client requirements)<br />-No settings are saved with jmeter project file.<br />-<b>Very Useful </b>to see results after a distributed test execution(aggregated results).<br />-<b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow<br /><br /><b><br /></b><b>Aggregate Report:</b><br />-Same facility as Simple Data Writer.<br />-Results are shown in tabular format(request count/min/max/average/error rate/approximate throughput (request/second) and KB/s throughput)<br />- When "Include group name in label?" is selected, the name of the thread group is added as a prefix to results.<br />-<b>Very Useful </b>to see results after a distributed test execution(aggregated results).<br />- <b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow <br /><br /><b>Assertion Results:</b><br />- Same facility as Simple Data Writer<br />- Reports any kind of Assertions fail results with failed sample label.<br />-<b>Very useful</b> for viewing saved results for validation.<br />-<b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow.<br /><br /><b>BeanShell Listener:</b><br />-BeanShell Listener allows the use of BeanShell for processing samples for saving<br />-When we need to apply condition(modification) in the execution time, this can be very useful.<br />Note: I have not used them yet. To know more about BeanShell, see <a href="http://www.beanshell.org/">this</a>.<br /><br /><b>BSF Listener:</b><br />-It runs BSF script code to be applied to sample results.<br />-It is used for processing results in a suitable way(following client requirements)<br />Note: I have not used this yet.<br /><br /><b>Comparison Assertion Visualizer:</b><br />-It shows the results of any&nbsp;Comparison Assertion element<br />-Same facility as Simple Data Writer<br />-It is a little bit resource hungry for the Comparison Assertion element, so try to avoid it<br />-It is <b>very nice</b> when we need to compare &amp; debug requests under assertion. <br /><br /><b>Distribution Graph (alpha):</b><br />-It will show a bar for every unique response time<br />-The graph will draw two threshold lines: 50% and 90%.This means, 50% of the response time finished between 0 and the line. Same is true of 90% line.<br />-Normally, A <b>good</b> application's<b> lines are near in hight. (wild fluctuations occurs for bad </b>application).<br />-Graphs with no apparent clumping or pattern, may indicate a memory leak, therefore we have to use a profiling tool.<br />-Same facility as Simple Data Writer&nbsp; <br />-It is good to view results after test run.<br />-<b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow.<br /><br /><b>Generate Summary Results:</b><br />-It can be placed anywhere<br />-Main purpose is , Logging or standard output<br />-Output can be generated after a period of time<br />-<b>Best uses </b>of this is in multiple test case synchronize running.<br />-It is mainly intended for batch (non-GUI) runs<br /><br /><b>Graph Results :</b><br />-It shows actual number of requests/minute that the server handle.<br />-We save result as a file (like simple data writer) <br />-It also used to view saved data/results.<br />-We can apply conditions(error/success). <br />-We can configure the Items to be saved(Press configuration)<br />-<b>Very Useful </b>to see results after run.<br />-<b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow. <br /><br /><br /><b>JSR223 Listener:</b><br />-It allows JSR223 script code to be applied to sample results.<br />-It is used for processing results in a suitable way(following client requirements)<br />Note: I have not used this yet.<br /><br /><b>Mailer Visualizer:</b><br />-It is used for sending mail notification for failed/passed conditions.<br />-Same facility as Simple Data Writer.&nbsp; <br />-All settings are mail related settings.<br />-It is a <b>very good </b>in case of <b>scheduled test plan</b> execution.<br />-Project stake holders can be notified for test status on error/passing conditions.<br />-It is best practices to use this<br /><br /><b>Monitor Results:</b><br />-Basically it is a Visualizer for displaying server status<br />-The "Health" tab shows the status of one or more servers<br />-The "Performance" shows the performance for one server for the last 1000 samples<br />-It requires Tomcat 5 or above<br />-Same facility as Simple Data Writer.<br />-It takes a lot of resources, so, when ever we need that, we have to specify the interval for monitor samples.(using constant timer).<br />-In my opinion, It is better to run the test separately(usually occasionally, when we are in a need to update server for better application support)&nbsp; for monitor results as it will monitor the servers rather than application's performance .<br /><br /><b>Response Time Graph:</b><br />-it is a line chart showing the evolution of response time during the test, for each labeled request(every request)<br />-Same facility as Simple Data Writer.<br />-It is better to define the graph settings(spatially following client requirements) <br />-No settings are saved with jmeter project file.<br />-If necessary , then use this while execution test. This also takes a lot of memory. Better to use this after execution.<br /><br /><b>Save Responses to a file:</b><br />- It can be placed anywhere in the test plan for saving file.<br />-In sample in its scope, it creates a file of the <b>response</b> Data<br />- Same facility as Simple Data Writer. <br />-It is vastly used when we create functional test cases.<br />-It is <b>very handy</b> when&nbsp; the response data is too large(for currently displaying in tree). It just save them in file.<br />-It saves file in document type.<br />-The current sample is saved first, followed by any sub-samples (child samples). <br />-If a variable name is provided,the names of the files are saved in the order that the sub-samples appear<br /><br /><b>Simple Data Writer :</b><br />-When we save results in our data as CSV/JTI file. <br />-We can apply conditions(error/success). <br />-We can configure the Items to be saved(Press configuration)<br />-It is best practice to use this for storing results which can be viewed after running tests.<br /><br /><b>Spline Visualizer:&nbsp;</b><br />- All options are same as Same as Graph Results but shows a view of all sample divided in 10 segments(10% each)<br />-It uses spline logic to show a single continuous line.<br />- It is <b>useful</b> for at a glance graph visibility over graph results.<br />-Like as Graph Results, <b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow.  <br /><br /><b>Summary Report:</b><br />-It creates a table row for each differently named request in test.<br />-It is a summary of view results in table<br />-It shows average results for separate sampler(EX- http  request )<br />-It is a kind of "Aggregate Report"<br />-It is good to view results of <b>&nbsp;non distributed</b> test.<br />- Same facility as Simple Data Writer. <br /><b><br /></b><b>View Results in Table:</b><br />-Same facility as View Result Tree but all are shows in tabular format.<br />-By default, it shows the main (parent) samples, on user checking,&nbsp; it displays the sub-samples (child samples)<br />-<b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow. <br /><br /><b>View Results Tree:</b><br />-View Results Tree shows a tree of all sample &amp; responses in details(HTML/Document/Text/JSON/Regexp Tester/XML format)<br />- Same facility as Simple Data Writer.<br />-If there is no content-type provided, then the content will not be displayed in the any of the Response Data panels<br />-By Default, the response data is larger than 200K, then it won't be displayed.Change the limit from JMeter property  <b>view.results.tree.max_size</b>. See this post for how to <a href="http://shantonusarker.blogspot.com/2013/01/configuring-jmeter-part-18-jmeter.html">edit.</a><br />-It is the <b>most useful listener for debugging </b>test case. There are various way to use this for optimizing the test plan, view requests, view responses.<br />-<b>Never Use</b> this while running test as it will cause memory overflow. <br /><br /></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>So, best practice, Save the results and see after test execution.</b><br /><br />Thanks...:)...
