<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">In this article we are going to see some tecniques that can be applied in robotium to use it smartly. This is not a complete post, I will add more tips &amp; tricks as the time goes. For basic ideas on robotium, please see my Mobile Testing section. Details , step by steps posts are there. <br /><br /><b>Sample test template </b>:<br /><br />I have created two projects for same test case where both are two ways to test same app(one with code, and another is without code). The concept is, there will be a base class maintaining all communication with android test runner. And all test classes will extend that class . All test classes will only contain test methods where as the base class will contain the main android unit test extension , setup, tear down. Here is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQeGhhQUZvS00tT3M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">screenshot </a>for more details. <br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQYzBScFljYVJ1bkk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Project with source code</a><br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQVGdhSTlmV0dqQmc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Project without source code</a><br /><br /><b>How to run Robotium Test Case?</b><br />-Run Emulator or device<br />-Check that the device is connected using "LogCat" /"Device from eclipse or using adb commands in command prompt.&nbsp; In "LogCat" or"Device", we can see device responses. <br />-Install debug version of app if you are using apk file to test(no source codes)<br />-Right click the the package you want to run in side eclipse(or the whole project)<br />-Select run as Android JUnit Test. If it is not in here, select Run Configuration , and use android junit test. <br />-Now , we see Emulator activity from log cat and test will be executed. In eclipse, we will see junit runner <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQZWJvVGpNR0x2eHc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">describing </a>the test progress &amp; results. <br /><br /><b>Debugging from Emulator and Eclipse :&nbsp;</b><br />- Use "LogCat" and "Device" in eclipse to see app's activity. Spatially what it is doing or interacting. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQaWtyVUZIdDNJVEE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">screenshot</a>. <br />To add "LogCat" or "Device, from eclipse, go to window &gt; show view . You will find device and logcat. If not , click other and you will see full list. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQUGRiSm92QVdCVFE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>. <br />- Try to avoid filter in log cat and use verbose type logcat view so that you can see detail activity of emulator . Spatially test application's activity and responses from android system . If you need to monitor specific activity , then use filter.<br />- From device, we can do a lot of advance and interesting stuffs like<br />a. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQdkxkdTl6eGtFSFU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Method profiling</a> : We can see a method's resource using , run time and all other information.<br />b. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQZVhNUnRLdlJVREU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Dump View Hierarchy</a> : We can dump view Hierarchy for automated UI tests. <br />c. Take screenshot : We can take screen shot any time we want. It will help for identifying bugs. <br />d. <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B-OmBwkwiTCQYk5hWG9WZGNMV3M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Capture system wide trace</a> : <br /><br /><br />Thanks...to be continued...:)&nbsp; </div><div class="blogger-post-footer">Thanks for reading my personal blog. contact: shantonu_oxford@yahoo.com</div>
