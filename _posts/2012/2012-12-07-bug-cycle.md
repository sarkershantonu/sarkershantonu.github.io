In this following article, we are going to see what is the life cycle of a bug. I will try to explain a bug life cycle from **initial stage** to **end** with touching maximum process.

### What is a Software Bug?
First, Just to inform, A software bug is an error, flaw, mistake, failure, or fault in a computer program or system that produces an incorrect or unexpected result, or causes it to behave in unintended ways. A bug is a specific concern about the quality of the Application under Test (AUT).

In software development testing time, when an issue which does not verify the requirements, it is reported as bug. The life cycle of a bug refers to beginning to end of a software bug. 

### Bug Lifecycle
1. When a bug is just found and posted(reported) for the first time, the state of the bug is called **New**.
2. When a New bug is available to team, the state of the bug is called **Open**. 
3. When an Open bug assigned to a developer for solving, the state of the bug is called **Assigned**.
4. When an Assigned bug solved by a developer and assign to a SQA for testing , the state of the bug is called **QA/Test**.
5. When the assigned bug investigated by a developer and found that the bug is not a genuine bug (a mistake by the taster or, wrong requirement provided or miss communication), the state of the bug is called **Rejected**. 
6.  When the assigned bug investigated by a developer and found that the reported bug is same to a previously reported bug , the state of the bug is called **8Duplicate**.
7. When the assigned bug investigated and decide to solve at a specific release(not now) by the team, the state of the bug is called **Deferred*8
8.  When an QA/Test bug is tested by a SQA/Tester and found solved , the state of the bug is called *8Verified**. 
9. When an QA/Test bug is tested by a SQA/Tester and found not solved or still exist  , the state of the bug is called **Reopened**. 
10. When an verified bug is judged by a tester that it is no longer exists in the software or system , the state of the bug is called **Closed**.
