What are the Qatar Airways travel requirements?
Travelling from Bangladesh
Many countries around the world have specific regulations in place for arriving and departing passengers in order to limit the spread of COVID-19. Please ensure that you have completed all the requirements you need to comply with before you travel.

In case that government regulation requires you to present a negative COVID-19 test result on departure and/or arrival, Qatar Airways will verify this information at check-in and retain a copy of the test result. Please have additional copies of the test result available with you for submission.
