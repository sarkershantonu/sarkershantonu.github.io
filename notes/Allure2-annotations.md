In this blog we are going to see how can we use Allure-2 Annotations in our test cases. 

If you are interested to know about Allure-1 annotations, one of [my old blog](https://sarkershantonu.github.io/2016/10/03/allure1/) you may read. 

### What is Alure?
Allure is an opensource report engine built using AngulaJs. It generates report based on maven surefire plugins. It has support for junit, testNG, cucumber-java, selenide, pytest, behav, jasmine, Mocha, RSpec, Spock, PHPUnit , SpecFlow, NUnit, MSTest etc unit testing framework. It has command line interface to generate report . And it has supports for popular CI/CD platform like jenkins, TeamCity, Banboo, Gradle, Maven, CodeFresh.

I am not putting details on why we need allure, to know details about allure reporting format, please see [**my old post**](https://sarkershantonu.github.io/2016/10/03/allure1/)
