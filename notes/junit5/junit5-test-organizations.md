This blogpost is fully preference from my work experience. These are my solo opinion. 

I follow test in these ways 

- A Test class = A scenario
- A Test Method = Single test under a scenario 
- A suite = a Story (Group of Scenarios together), a feature (Group of Stories together), a Release (group of features together)

A suite containing single or multiple stories

A suite containing single or multiple features 

A suite containing single or multiple Releases 

A suite containing all tests 

A suite containing Regression Suite
